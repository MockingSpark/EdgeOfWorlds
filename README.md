# EDGE OF WORLDS

A simple proof of concept of a Tactical RPG.

This project was realized without external game engine as my second year's final assignement (1st year of Master degree) at Telecom Sudparis, France.

The objective of the assignement was to deliver a proof of concept of a game within 2 weeks with at least 3 external libraries, programmed in C++14 with no external game engine, and implementing 2 game programming patterns from our lectures.

I left the result as-is to show what I could do at the time within two weeks.

Used libraries : 
- tmxlite
- Tiled
- SFML

All code and sprites except form those libraries or other notice was made by me (MockingSpark) specifically for this assignement
